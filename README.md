# HVAC Energy Predictor Final Project

## Background

Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for approximately 25% to 50% of the total energy consumption in residential buildings. Architectural design factors, including building size, shape, and orientation, significantly impact heating and cooling loads. A detailed analysis of these relationships can lead to the development of more energy-efficient home designs.

For a detailed description of the dataset used in this project, please refer to the dataset documentation [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/242/energy+efficiency).

## Objectives

1. **Literature Review**:
   - Investigate the challenges associated with minimizing HVAC energy consumption in residential settings.
   - Assess the benefits of using data models for predicting HVAC energy requirements compared to traditional methods.

2. **Data Analysis and Modeling**:
   - Analyze the provided dataset to build models predicting heating and cooling loads.
   - Develop and validate these models based on various architectural features.

3. **User Interface Development**:
   - Create an interface that allows users to input data and receive estimates for heating and cooling loads.
   - Implement functionality for users to add new observations to the database, with automatic updates to the data models.

## Tasks

1. **Literature Research**:
   - Describe the challenges of reducing HVAC energy consumption.
   - Summarize the advantages of using data models for HVAC energy prediction compared to conventional methods.

2. **Database Analysis**:
   - Explore and analyze the dataset to build predictive models for heating and cooling loads.
   - Evaluate the impact of architectural features on energy consumption.

3. **Interface Design**:
   - Develop a user interface for estimating HVAC energy loads.
   - Include features for users to add new data entries and ensure that the models are updated automatically.
